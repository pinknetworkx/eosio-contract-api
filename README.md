# EOSIO Contract API
The aim of this project is to provide an framework to fill and query state and history for specific
contracts on eosio based blockchains. 

This project uses the eosio State History Plugin as data source and PostgreSQL to store / query the data.
Per block transactions guarantee that the database is consistent at any time.

## Requirements

* NodeJS >= 14.0
* PostgreSQL >= 12.4
* Redis >= 5.0
* Nodeos >= 1.8.0 (only tested with 2.0) The state history plugin needs to be enabled and the options: 
`trace-history = true`, `chain-state-history = true`

Suggestions
* Hasura GraphQL Engine >= 1.3 (if you want to allow GraphQL queries)
* PGAdmin 4 (Interface to manage the postgres database)

## Configuration
The config folder contains 3 different configuration files

#### connections.config.json
This file contains Postgres / Redis / Nodeos connection data for the used chain.

Notes
* Redis: Can be used for multiple chains without further action
* PostgreSQL: Each chain needs it own postgres database (can use the same postgres instance), but multiple readers of the same
chain can use the same database if they are non conflicting
* Nodeos: nodeos should have a full state history for the range you are trying to index

## Installation

This project consists of two separated processes which need to be started and stopped independently:
* The API which will provide the socket and REST endpoints (or whatever is used)
* The filler which will read the data from the blockchain and fills the database

The filler needs to be started before the API when running it for the first time:

Prerequisites:
- PostgreSQL
  - Create a database and user which is allowed to read and write on that db
    
- EOSIO node 
  - State History Plugin enabled with options `trace-history = true`, `chain-state-history = true`
  - Fully synced for the block range you want to process
  - Open socket and http api

- Copy and modify example configs with the correct connection params

There are two suggested ways to run the project: Docker if you want to containerize the application or PM2 if you want to run it on system level

### Docker

1. `git clone && cd eosio-contract-api`
2. There is an example docker compose file provided
3. `docker-compose up -d`

Start
* `docker-compose start eosio-contract-api-filler`
* `docker-compose start eosio-contract-api-server`

Stop
* `docker-compose stop eosio-contract-api-filler`
* `docker-compose stop eosio-contract-api-server`

### PM2

1. `git clone && cd eosio-contract-api`
2. `yarn install`
3. `yarn global add pm2`

Start
* `pm2 start ecosystems.config.json --only eosio-contract-api-filler`
* `pm2 start ecosystems.config.json --only eosio-contract-api-server`

Stop
* `pm2 stop eosio-contract-api-filler`
* `pm2 stop eosio-contract-api-server`

## Currently Supported Contracts

### Readers (used to fill the database)

Readers are used to fill the database for a specific contract.

#### atomicassets

```javascript
{
  "handler": "atomicassets",
  "args": {
    "atomicassets_account": "atomicassets" // account where the atomicassets contract is deployed
    "store_transfers": true // store the transfer history  
    "store_logs": true // store data structure logs
  }
}
```

#### atomicmarket
This reader requires a atomicassets and a delphioracle reader with the same contract as specified here
```javascript
{
  "handler": "atomicmarket",
  "args": {
    "atomicassets_account": "atomicassets" // account where the atomicassets contract is deployed
    "atomicmarket_account": "atomicmarket" // account where the atomicmarket contract is deployed
    "store_logs": true // Store logs of sales / auctions
  }
}
```

#### delphioracle

```javascript
{
  "handler": "delphioracle",
  "args": {
    "delphioracle_account": "delphioracle" // account where the delphioracle contract is deployed
  }
}
```

### Namespace (API endpoints)

A namespace provides an API for a specific contract or use case and is based on data a reader provides

#### atomicassets

```javascript
{
  "handler": "atomicassets",
  "args": {
    "atomicassets_account": "atomicassets" // account where the atomicassets contract is deployed
    "connected_reader": "atomic-1" // reader to which the API connects for live data
  }
}
```

#### atomicmarket

```javascript
{
  "handler": "atomicmarket",
  "args": {
    "atomicmarket_account": "atomicmarket", // account where the atomicmarket contract is deployed
    "connected_reader": "atomic-1" // reader to which the API connects for live data
  }
}
```
